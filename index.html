<p>My name is Ahammed Hisham Anvar and I am from India. I came from Dubai to Germany last year. I am living with my family here. I am currently studying in the <em>State Vocational School in Herzogenaurach</em> in Germany. My hobbies are playing football,cricket and reading.<br> I only have a basic knowledge of HTML and CSS and want to refresh my knowledge if I take up any future career related to tech. I've been a tech fanatic and always dreamed to work in an IT field sice I was a kid, thanks to my father.<br> I look to further refresh my knowledge and develop my skils in the tech industry in order to earn a high-profile status  in the tech industry.</p>
